# NDX Implementation Ledger

Required by `specs/NeuroDeck_OS_Production_Implementation_Mega_Prompt.md` §4.3. This document must stay current throughout implementation — update it as part of every epic, not just at the end of Epic 0.

## Repository baseline (Epic 0)

| Item                                | Finding                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State before Epic 0                 | Pre-bootstrap. Only `specs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`, `HANDOFF.md` existed. No package manager, no source code, no git history.                   |
| Package manager                     | npm (lockfile: `package-lock.json`)                                                                                                                                   |

| Tailwind version                    | 4.x, integrated via `@tailwindcss/vite` (no `tailwind.config.js` needed — v4 uses CSS-first config via `@import 'tailwindcss'` in `src/renderer/src/assets/base.css`) |

## Architecture findings

- The mega-prompt's `src/` ownership tree (§7) places renderer-owned folders (`app`, `controller`, `features`, `components`, `state`, `services`) directly under `src/`. electron-vite's actual build tooling expects renderer source under `src/renderer/src/` (governed by `tsconfig.web.json` and the renderer Vite config) — those folders were created under `src/renderer/src/` instead to match the real build boundary. `shared/` (contracts/schemas/errors/constants/types) was kept at the top level (`src/shared/`) since it must be importable from `main`, `preload`, and `renderer` alike, and is aliased as `@shared/*` in all three electron-vite build targets plus both tsconfigs and `vitest.config.mts`.
- **Recorded deviation from spec §7, resolved per the conflict-precedence rule in `CLAUDE.md` §2** (existing repository architecture / build tooling outranks the implementation prompt's illustrative tree when they conflict on mechanics rather than intent). The ownership boundaries and folder names are unchanged; only their position relative to `src/renderer/src/` differs.
- All ownership folders for Epics 1–12 and the `core/` service folders are scaffolded as empty directories with `.gitkeep` placeholders — intentionally inert, no logic, no fake exports.

## Security findings

See `docs/security/NDX_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full detail. Summary:

- **Found and fixed:** scaffold defaulted to `sandbox: false` and unconditional `shell.openExternal` for any URL — both violated the mandatory baseline (§6) and were corrected in `src/main/security/windowSecurity.ts` before any feature code was written.
- **Found and fixed:** dead non-isolated fallback branch in `src/preload/index.ts` (two `@ts-ignore` comments) — removed since `contextIsolation: true` is now mandatory and unconditional.
- **Accepted, tracked risk:** `npm audit` reports 5 vulnerabilities, all confined to the Vitest dev/UI server dependency chain (devDependency only, not packaged). Revisit at Epic 12 security pass.
- **Forward note:** the generic `@electron-toolkit/preload` IPC wrapper is wider than spec's narrow-typed-API requirement; acceptable now only because no feature code uses it. Epic 4 must replace it with typed/Zod-validated contracts before any IPC-using feature ships.

## Controller findings

Not applicable yet — no controller runtime exists (Epic 2 is the first epic that introduces it). Nothing to audit.

## Mock/stub inventory (danger-pattern search, §4.2)

Searched `mock|fake|stub|placeholder|TODO|FIXME|coming soon|setTimeout|Math\.random|sampleData|demoData|hardcoded|@ts-ignore|eslint-disable|catch \{\}|console\.log|localStorage|sessionStorage` across the repo (excluding `specs/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`):

| Match              | File                                                     | Classification                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@ts-ignore` ×2    | `src/preload/index.ts` (pre-cleanup)                     | Dead code from scaffold's non-isolated fallback branch — **removed**, see Security findings above.                                   |
| `mock`/`fake`/etc. | `CLAUDE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`, `HANDOFF.md` | Documentation-only references (these terms appear because the docs describe the _prohibition_ on mocks). Not code. No action needed. |
| `mock`/`fake`/etc. | `package-lock.json`                                      | Dependency tree metadata (package names/descriptions containing these substrings incidentally). Not code. No action needed.          |

No production mocks, stubs, placeholders, fake data, or `console.log` statements exist in `src/` as of Epic 0 completion. This is expected and correct — no features have been built yet for there to be anything to fake.

## Screen inventory status

0 of 56 core screens (ND-001–ND-056) implemented. 0 of the supplemental screens implemented. This is expected at Epic 0 — screen work begins at Epic 1 (shell) and Epic 3 (first screens, ND-001–ND-012).

## IPC inventory

No application-defined IPC channels exist. The only IPC surface is `@electron-toolkit/preload`'s generic `electronAPI`, exposed but unused by any feature code (`window.api` is an empty object, reserved for Epic 4's typed contracts).

## Test inventory

| Suite                              | Location                                        | Count    | Status                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Unit — `urlPolicy` pure predicates | `src/main/security/__tests__/urlPolicy.test.ts` | 11 tests | Passing                  |
| Component — baseline `App` shell   | `src/renderer/src/__tests__/App.test.tsx`       | 1 test   | Passing                  |
| E2E — Electron boot smoke test     | `e2e/app.spec.ts`                               | 1 test   | Passing (see note below) |

**E2E environment note:** the sandboxed dev shell this was built in exports `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` globally, which forces Electron's native bootstrap into plain-Node mode for _any_ child process that inherits it — including Playwright's `_electron.launch()`. The fix (deleting the key from the env object passed to `electron.launch`, not just setting it to `''` — Electron checks for the variable's _presence_, not its value) is now baked into `e2e/app.spec.ts` itself, so the test is robust on any host, not just this one.

## Work sequence

Following `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` Phase A, Epic 0 → Epic 12, then Phase B Epic X1 → X15. Epic 0 is now complete; Epic 1 (Shell and design system) is next.

## Decisions and assumptions

1. **AI provider(s), extension marketplace v1 scope, additional Linux packaging targets, sync provider(s)** — all flagged as open product decisions in `HANDOFF.md`; none block Epic 0–3 work.
2. **Renderer-owned folder placement** — see Architecture findings above; folders live under `src/renderer/src/` rather than directly under `src/` to match electron-vite's real build boundaries, preserving the spec's ownership _names_ and _boundaries_ exactly.
3. **Vitest dependency vulnerabilities accepted as a tracked, dev-only risk** rather than forcing a breaking major-version upgrade mid-baseline — see Security findings.
4. **Tailwind v4's CSS-first configuration** was used instead of a `tailwind.config.js` (v3 style) since the spec only mandates "Tailwind CSS" generically and v4 is the current stable release; design tokens will be formalized in Epic 1 §8.1 regardless of which Tailwind config style hosts them.

## Completed items with evidence

### Epic 0 — Baseline and safety

- [x] **Repository audit** — see Repository baseline table above.
- [x] **Ledger created** — this document.
- [x] **Build repair / project scaffolded and building** — evidence: `npm run build` succeeds (electron-vite builds main 2.73 kB, preload 0.42 kB, renderer with Tailwind CSS 7.36 kB + JS bundle).
- [x] **Test baseline established** — evidence: `npm run test` → 2 files, 12 tests passing; `npm run test:e2e` → 1 test passing.
- [x] **Security baseline applied** — evidence: `docs/security/NDX_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`; hardened `webPreferences` in `src/main/index.ts` via `HARDENED_WEB_PREFERENCES`; navigation/external-link allowlisting in `src/main/security/`.
- [x] **Mock/stub inventory completed** — see table above; zero production mocks found; one dead-code finding (preload fallback) fixed.
- [x] **Dead-code analysis** — preload non-isolated fallback branch removed (see Security findings); no other dead code identified (codebase is new, nothing has had a chance to rot).

**Validation evidence (all run from repo root, all green):**

```text
npm run typecheck   → tsc --noEmit (node) + tsc --noEmit (web): 0 errors
npm run lint        → eslint --cache .: 0 errors, 0 warnings
npm run test        → vitest run: 2 files, 12 tests passed
npm run build       → typecheck + electron-vite build: succeeded, 0 errors
npm run test:e2e    → playwright test: 1 passed
npm audit           → 5 vulnerabilities, all in vitest's dev-only dependency chain (accepted, tracked — see Security findings)
```

## Remaining risks

- Vitest dependency chain vulnerabilities (dev-only, tracked for Epic 12).
- `applyNavigationPolicy` lacks an integration test against a live `BrowserWindow` (only pure predicates are unit tested) — tracked for Epic 12 security pass.
- Generic (non-typed) IPC wrapper exposed but unused — must not be load-bearing for any feature before Epic 4 lands typed contracts.

## Deferred items with explicit reason

- **Typed IPC contracts, permission broker, audit log** — deferred to Epic 4; no AI runtime or tool registry exists yet to define contracts against.
- **CI/CD workflow configuration** — not part of Epic 0's defined scope (mega-prompt assigns this to Epic 12 packaging/hardening); local validation commands (`typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `build`, `test:e2e`) are documented and passing in the meantime.
- **Design tokens (§8.1)** — deferred to Epic 1; Tailwind is wired up and building, but no token system exists yet beyond the framework itself.
